        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-8">
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a maximum of three attempts for each exam.</li>
                    <li>For most courses, you need to have an attendance of at least 75%, otherwise you will lose your first exam attempt.</li>
                    <li>You are automatically registered for exams, when all compulsory study activities have been approved.</li>
                    <li>The evaluation form for a course is specified in the course description for the individual courses.</li>
                    <li>It is not possible to deregister from an examination. If the student does not attend the examination, it counts as an attempt.</li>
                    <li>Failure to submit a basis for oral exam or for assessment of subjects without examination, as stated in the course description, means that the student cannot attend the examination. Consequently, it counts as an attempt.</li>
                    <li>Failure to submit a basis required according to the course description (compulsory tests, assignments, presentation or the like) means that the student cannot attend the examination. Consequently, this counts as an attempt.</li>
                    <li>Elective courses studied at other programmes must always be assessed before credits can be issued.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>External and internal examinations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examinations are either with one or more internal examiners, or one or more internal examiners and an external examiner.</li>
                    <li>For examinations with internal examiners, the examiner or examiners are appointed by the institution (usually among the teachers at VIA).</li>
                    <li> For external examinations, the Ministry of Education appoints the examiner.</li>
                    <li>A course is assessed either with or without external censorship. As a whole, at least 1/3 of the degree programme must be documented by external examinations. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special examination conditions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a student has language difficulties or disabilities, it is possible to apply for special examinationconditions or an extended examination time.</li>
                    <li>If there are language difficulties, due to the student having a mother tongue other than Danish, the general practice is that extended examination time is granted only within the first 1Â½ academic year.</li>
                    <li>Should language difficulties be due to dyslexia, the student must be tested for this. The study counsellor may be contacted on this.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Illness</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a student becomes ill on the day of the exam, the student shall immediately inform the study administration.</li>
                    <li>If the student becomes ill during an oral exam, the student must report this to the lecturer. </li>
                    <li>In case of illness during a written examination, the student must summon the invigilator, who notes that the exam is interrupted due to illness</li>
                    <li>The student must seek medical advice on the examination day and provide evidence of the illness. The documentation must be forwarded to the study administration no later than 4 workdays after the examination date. The student must cover any costs associated with the documentation. If the student is unable to prove that he / she was ill, it will count as an attempt.</li>
                    <li>If the student is exposed to a violent incident that prevents participation in an exam, the student must report this to the study administration as soon as possible. In collaboration with the lecturer, the student counsellor or the head of programme, the study administration may consider whether the event is comparable to the rules for illness. If this is the outcome, the examination attempt will be cancelled.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Self-study</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Courses or projects not passed by examination or other form for tests may be re-read by self-study. The student cannot follow the course again unless permission on grounds of special circumstances is obtained from the head of programme. Application is forwarded via the study counsellors to the head of programme no later than one week after the failed examination attempt.</li>
                </ul></div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Re-examination</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Re-examinations, make-up examinations or re-testing are held approximately 2-3 weeks after the new semester has started or in connection with the following ordinary examination period.</li>
                    <li>For students who have attended a course for the first time and failed the examination: If a course or project is only offered once a year, re-examination or re-testing is conducted either in the next ordinary exam period or approximately 2 weeks after the following semester has started. </li>
                    <li>Especially applicable to students who study for their final semester: For students who only need to pass one of the examinations placed in the final examination period, according to the curriculum, re-examinations is scheduled approximately 2-3 weeks after the following semester start.</li>
                    <li>In case of failing an examination, the student is automatically enrolled in the next re-examination.</li>
                    <li>A student can only attempt an examination in the same course or project three times. These three examination attempts must follow immediately after each other, i.e. examinations offered in three consecutive semesters. In exceptional circumstances VIA may authorize a fourth and possibly a fifth attempt.</li>
                    <li>For courses assessed without examination, the re-examination may be arranged as an oral or written examination. In this case, VIA will appoint an internal examiner.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Time limits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The programme must be passed within the number of years that corresponds to the prescribed study period plus two years. If the time limit is not observed, the student will be withdrawn from the programme. </li>
                    <li>In exceptional circumstances, the head of programme may dispense with the above. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cheating and disturbing behaviour at examinations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When completing a written test, the examinee must confirm with a signature that the assignment has been completed without use of illicit aid. The signature may be digital.</li>
                    <li>Plagiarism is considered to be cheating if it is found in a written assignment that the student has submitted for use during an examination.</li>
                    <li>There is plagiarism present when a student in a written assignment attempts to give the impression that he or she is the author of an idea, text, setup or similar, even though the author is actually another.</li>
                    <li>VIA has the right to dismiss an examinee from an examination if the student exhibits disruptive behaviour, i.e. if the examinee exhibits noisy behaviour or violates VIA's rules of conduct during the examination. In less serious cases, the programme may issue a warning first. The examiner reports the incident to the head of programme.</li>
                    <li>Anyone who suspects cheating at an examination, is obliged to follow up on the suspicion and - if presumption is maintained - to report the matter to the head of programme. </li>
                    <li>Based on the report and the conversation, the head of programme will decide whether it is a matter of cheating and consequently, what kind of sanction is relevant to the student. The head of programme can make a decision on sanction only if he is convinced that the evidence on cheating is beyond reasonable doubt.</li>
